### I Forget that you existed


How many days did I spend thinking about how you did me wrong wrong wrong 

Live in the shade you were throwing till all of my sunshine was gone gone gone.

And I couldn't get away from you,

In my feeling more than Drake so ya

You name on my lips，tougue-tied

Free rent，living in my mind.

But then something happened on magical night.

I forgot you were existed

And I thought it would kill me but it didn't

And it was so nice

So peaceful and quiet

I forgot you were existed

It is lovers, it is haters just in difference

I forgot you 

Got up some popcorn as soon as my raps started going down down down

Laugh on the school yard as soon as i tripped up and hit the ground ground ground

And I wouldn't stuck around for ya

Wouldn't fought whole town so ya

Wouldn't been rigth there from roll 

Even if nobody came to your soul

But you show who you are then with a magical night
 
~~~~repeat echo

Send me a clear message

Tought me some hot lessons

I just forgot what they were 

It's all just a blur


### Cruel Summer
